/// item was removed from `UsdtConsensusItem` and `SigningPurpose` lost its
/// debug-only variant -- both consensus-encoded types changed shape, so old
/// and new binaries can no longer agree on the wire format.
///
/// Bumped to `0.2` (sec-13 hardening): the (since-removed) deposit-check API
/// response gained a `ready` field, changing its wire shape at the time. The
/// whole guardian-poll deposit path was later removed when deposit crediting
/// became proof-driven (see [`UsdtInput::DepositProofV0`]); this historical
/// note is retained only to explain the version number.
///
/// Bumped to `0.3` (sec-misc #4/06-facet): [`WithdrawFeeQuoteResponse`] and
/// [`DepositFeeQuoteResponse`] gained an `available` field (their wire shape
/// changed). Neither type is a stored consensus-DB record (they are computed
/// on the fly from the `FeeVote` table on every call), so no
/// `get_database_migrations` entry/snapshot is needed for this bump.
///
/// Bumped to `0.4` (sec-06 hardening): `FeeVoteKey`'s stored value changed
/// from a bare `FeeVote` to `StoredFeeVote` (adds a `recorded_block`
/// freshness stamp), a consensus-DB record shape change handled by
/// `migrate_db_v0`.
///
/// Bumped to `0.5` (sec-04/12/15 hardening): the (since-removed)
/// `DepositObservation`,
/// [`UserOpReceipt`](user_op::UserOpReceipt), the server's
/// `UserOpConfirmedObservation`, and the [`UsdtConsensusItem::UserOpConfirmed`]
/// consensus item all gained a `block_hash` field binding an observation to a
/// canonical fork (so reorg-divergent votes no longer aggregate). The two
/// affected vote tables (`DepositObservationVote`, `UserOpConfirmedVote`) are
/// transient and re-formed every scan/submit tick, so `migrate_db_v1` DROPS
/// their old-shape rows rather than rewriting them (mirroring
/// `migrate_db_v0`).
///
/// Bumped to `0.7` (sec-05 hardening, poisoned-batch isolation): a brand-new
/// consensus-DB record, `WithdrawalBatchCapKey(OutPoint) -> u32`, was added
/// (server's `db.rs`). It is a new prefix holding only new data -- no
/// existing stored value's shape changed -- so no `get_database_migrations`
/// entry/snapshot was needed, only `dump_database` coverage.
///
/// Bumped to `0.8` (sec-09 hardening, terminal-withdrawal refund): several
/// consensus-serialized types changed shape to reissue e-cash for a
/// terminally-failed withdrawal. [`UsdtOutputV0`] gained a client-controlled
/// `refund_pubkey`; [`UsdtInput`] gained a `RefundV0 { out_point }` variant
/// (and [`UsdtInputError`] an `UnknownRefund`); the
/// [`UsdtConsensusItem::UserOpConfirmed`] item and the server's
/// `UserOpConfirmedObservation` gained `actual_gas_cost_wei` (so a failed
/// batch's on-chain gas can be deducted from the refund). Two new server
/// consensus-DB records were added -- `RefundKey(OutPoint) -> Refund` (the
/// reissuance obligation, subtracted by `audit` and cleared exactly once on
/// claim) and `WithdrawalIncurredFeeKey(OutPoint) -> UsdtAmount` (the
/// per-withdrawal accumulated incurred gas) -- and the persistent
/// `UsdtWithdrawalV0` record gained `refund_pubkey`. See `migrate_db_v3` for
/// how the persistent `UsdtWithdrawalV0` change is handled.
///
/// Bumped to `0.9` (deposit-by-proof feature): several consensus-serialized
/// types and DB keyspaces changed shape to make deposit crediting
/// proof-driven rather than guardian-poll-driven. On the wire,
/// [`UsdtConsensusItem`] gained a `BlockHash` variant (the canonical
/// block-hash anchor vote, Task 4) and [`UsdtInput`] gained a
/// `DepositProofV0` variant (with new [`UsdtInputError`] variants, Task 5).
/// In the consensus DB, two new prefixes were added -- `BlockHashRing`
/// (`0x13`, Task 3) and `BlockHashVote` (`0x14`, Task 4) -- and the old
/// guardian-poll `PendingCheck` table (prefix `0x05`) was removed (Task 6),
/// leaving `0x05` a permanent gap in `DbKeyPrefix`. The two new prefixes
/// start empty and fill at runtime (no migration needed for them); any
/// residual `PendingCheck` rows are dropped by `migrate_db_v4`. Existing
/// `DepositRecord`s are untouched (their `credited` high-water marks carry
/// forward). See `migrate_db_v4`.
///
/// Bumped to `0.10` (finding B1): the over-ceiling withdrawal-reprice path in
/// the server's `process_replace_user_op` no longer refunds-and-purges a
/// still-live, threshold-signed op. The old behavior reissued the covered
/// withdrawals' e-cash as a refund AND removed the op even though its
/// `(sender, nonce)` was still live on-chain with an unconsumed nonce, so a
/// later confirmation paid the recipient a SECOND time (double pay). The op is
/// now kept live so a later confirmation settles it exactly-once via
/// `apply_user_op_confirmed`.
///
/// Over-ceiling reprice re-evaluation (still `0.10`; refines unreleased
/// behavior, no version bump -- security review F4): a withdrawal whose reprice
/// would exceed the covered withdrawals' committed `max_fee` ceiling now STALLS
/// but stays eligible to reprice later. Previously the stall marked the op
/// `superseded`, which permanently removed it from `propose_replace_user_ops`'
/// re-evaluation, so it could only ever settle at its ORIGINAL fee even if gas
/// later fell to a level where the reprice would fit under the ceiling --
/// wedging the one-batch-at-a-time withdrawal queue for that whole window.
/// Instead the over-ceiling apply path is now a non-state-changing `Err` (no
/// DB write, no consensus-history bloat) that leaves the `SubmittedUserOp` LIVE
/// and NON-superseded, and `propose_replace_user_ops` gates a timed-out
/// `Withdraw` op on a shared, deterministic affordability check: it proposes a
/// reprice only when the current fee median prices the batch back UNDER the
/// committed ceiling. The stall thus self-heals -- the reprice fires the moment
/// fees fall under the ceiling -- while a late on-chain confirm still settles
/// the live op exactly-once (no double pay). This is a deterministic apply/
/// propose-path BEHAVIOR change only: no consensus-serialized type, wire shape,
/// or DB record layout changed, so there is no `get_database_migrations`
/// entry/snapshot for these bumps.
///
/// Bumped to `0.11` (finding A): batched recovery of stranded `EntryPoint` gas
/// deposits. Single-use deposit accounts are deployed and swept once and then
/// abandoned, but the ERC-4337 `EntryPoint` gas deposit funding that
/// deploy-and-sweep op is left stranded in the account's `EntryPoint` balance.
/// The federation now automatically recovers that residual by building a
/// threshold-signed op that calls `EntryPoint.withdrawTo(recipient, amount)`
/// and sends the residual to a DETERMINISTIC recipient. On the wire,
/// [`UsdtConsensusItem`] gained a `RecoverResidual` variant (a per-peer
/// observation vote of a swept account's on-chain `EntryPoint` deposit) and
/// `UserOpPurpose` gained a `RecoverResidual` variant (both append-only); the
/// consensus config gained a `residual_recovery_recipient` `EvmAddress` field
/// (the per-guardian broadcaster is non-deterministic and cannot be the
/// recipient of a threshold-signed op). No DB migration; the new enum variants
/// are append-only and no keyspace changed. Existing feds must be reconfigured
/// to set the new consensus field.
///
/// Residual-recovery vote hygiene (still `0.11`; refines unreleased behavior,
/// no version bump): a `RecoverResidual` vote is now VALIDATED before it is
/// stored -- rejected (non-state-changingly) unless its account exists and is
/// fully swept -- and ALL of an account's recovery votes are GARBAGE-COLLECTED
/// when a recovery op for it confirms (success or revert). Together this keeps
/// the vote table bounded and forces every recovery to re-cross a FRESH
/// threshold of votes, so stale post-recovery votes plus one byzantine
/// vote-flip can no longer re-trigger a bogus oversized recovery.
///
/// Bumped to `0.12`: guardian fee withdrawal. Appends two trailing
/// `UsdtAmount` fields (`DepositRecord.fees_accrued`, `PoolState.accrued_fees`,
/// migrated by `migrate_db_v5`), appends `UserOpPurpose::WithdrawFees` and
/// `UsdtConsensusItem::WithdrawFeesVote` (both append-only wire variants), and
/// adds the `WithdrawFeesVote` keyspace (`0x16`). Read-side:
/// `PoolStateResponse` gains an `accrued_fees` field.
///
/// Bumped to `0.13`: two BREAKING wire changes that landed under `0.12` and
/// should not have. Deleting the legacy observation deposit path removed
/// `UsdtInput::V0`, and charging the deposit fee added a field to
/// `DepositProofV0`. `fedimint-derive` encodes enum variants by POSITIONAL
/// INDEX (`derive_enum_variant_encode_block(variant_idx, ..)`), so removing a
/// variant renumbers every variant after it: `DepositProofV0` moved from index
/// 2 to index 1, which a `0.12` peer decodes as `RefundV0`.
///
/// Because both sides still advertised `0.12`, the version handshake accepted
/// the pairing and the mismatch surfaced only as a deposit submission that
/// hung forever. Bumping makes it a clean handshake rejection instead. This is
/// the whole reason the version exists; the cost of getting it wrong is silent
/// misinterpretation of value-bearing inputs.
///
/// When editing a wire enum, prefer appending a variant to reordering or
/// deleting one — deletion is a breaking change even when nothing references
